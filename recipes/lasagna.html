        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>Bolognese Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Combine pancetta, onion, celery, glove and carrot in sauté pan with butter and cook over 
                    medium heat until onion turns pale gold. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add the ground beef (and pork) and increase the heat to high. Cook until browned. Sprinkle 
                    with pepper and a pinch of salt. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and simmer over LOW heat for 
                    about 2 hours.. If the sauce dries too much during cooking, add a little meat broth. Towards 
                    the end, add the milk to dampen the acidity of the tomato. Season with salt, nutmeg and pepper.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Bechamel Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Melt the unsalted butter with the flour over low heat. Stir rapidly with a spoon. Cook this 
                    for 1 minute and then remove from the heat. Meanwhile, heat the milk until almost boiling.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Slowly put the hot milk to your butter and flour mixture. During this process stir constantly. 
                    When the milk is completely poured over the roux sauce, put the saucepan back on low heat. 
                    Keep mixing constantly, until you have a fairly thick consistency (about 10/15 minutes).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Finally, add a pinch of fine salt and grated nutmeg to taste and continue stirring until the 
                    right consistency has developed.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Finally, the Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven at 190° C (375° F).  Cook the lasagna about 8 minutes in 6 quarts of boiling
                    salted water. Drain, rinse with cold water.Lay the individual lasagna noodles out on kitchen 
                    towels, not touching, so they do not stick together while you layer the casserole. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In a baking pan (do not use aluminum), cover the bottom with Bolognese, then add layer(s) of 
                    lasagna sheet and then the Bechamel. Repeat it for 2 to 3 times. Finish sprinkling with the 
                    grated Parmesan
                </p>
                <p>
                    Monte a lasanha num refratário grande, alternando camadas de molho bolognese, massa, molho branco, 
                    mussarela e parmesão, terminando com molho bolognesa e parmesão.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake for 20-30 minutes, until the top begins to get lightly browned. Remove from oven and let cool 
                    5-10 minutes before serving. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    bon appetit.
                </p>
            </li>
            
        </ol>
